00:03.720 --> 00:04.920
It's been a while since we talked,

00:04.920 --> 00:07.240
right? I just wanted to know what

00:07.240 --> 00:08.200
you've been up to, Morgan.

00:14.320 --> 00:15.680
Why do you ask if you already know

00:15.680 --> 00:18.520
the answer? I've been doing the only

00:18.520 --> 00:19.880
thing my father taught me to do,

00:21.160 --> 00:21.840
weapons.

00:25.920 --> 00:27.720
What is this? Place whoever you are,

00:28.400 --> 00:30.760
stay down, Dad.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.440
You come from a breach in our

00:36.440 --> 00:39.520
reality called 517, one of those

00:39.520 --> 00:41.480
that lost the battle against Thanos.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.320
Maybe it's a second chance.

00:47.120 --> 00:48.600
They're coming because of me.

00:50.960 --> 00:51.640
I got to go back

00:54.840 --> 00:55.560
before he does.

00:55.560 --> 00:55.640
I'm.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.280
Not going to lose him again.
