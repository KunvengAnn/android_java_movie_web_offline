1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,920
It's been a while since we talked,

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,240
right? I just wanted to know what

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,200
you've been up to, Morgan.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,680
Why do you ask if you already know

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,520
the answer? I've been doing the only

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,880
thing my father taught me to do,

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,840
weapons.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,720
What is this? Place whoever you are,

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,760
stay down, Dad.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,440
You come from a breach in our

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,520
reality called 517, one of those

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,480
that lost the battle against Thanos.

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Maybe it's a second chance.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,600
They're coming because of me.

15
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,640
I got to go back

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,560
before he does.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:55,640
I'm.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,280
Not going to lose him again.
